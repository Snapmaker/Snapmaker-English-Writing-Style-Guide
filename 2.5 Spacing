## **2.5 Spacing**

Misplaced spaces can confuse your audience and give a bad impression.

While writing, follow these rules:

* Insert a space between numbers and units of measure, except when the unit of measure in question is visualised by a superscripted sign, such as **°** (degree), **'** (foot) and **"** (inch), in which case you should omit the spacing. Product naming is another exception, where no space is needed between the number and unit of measure.
* Insert a space before and after a phrase from another language.
* Insert a blank line between two paragraphs.

For example, don't say:

* As a desktop 3D printer, F250 offers a 320 × 350 × 220mm work area.
* The module stops working automatically whenever its temperature sensor detects a higher than normal (one that exceeds 55 ℃/131 ℉) working temperature.
* Bring them to life now with the right tool: the 10 W High Power Laser Module.
* This inevitably gives rise to what we call知之者胜，不知之者不胜in Chinese.

* This inevitably gives rise to what we call 知之者胜，不知之者不胜 in Chinese.

Pay close attention to the spacing between words when they are connected by punctuation marks. Generally, insert one space after a punctuation mark, except for the following cases where you should put:

* No space adjacent to the slash or hyphen.
* One space before the opening bracket, and none between the closing bracket, if the sentence ends with parenthesis.
* One space before and after the ampersand.
* One space before and after the multiplication sign.

Should you need to use Chinese Pinyin, don't put spacing within the pinyin.
