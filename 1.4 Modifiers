## **1.4 Modifiers**

### 1.4.1 Misplaced Modifiers

Modifiers should be put adjacent to the words they modify. When you separate the modifier from the word it describes, it can create confusion.

In the following text, **for no reason** is intended to describe **stop**, but they are separated by a string of words:

>If the linear modules stop while the machine is working for no reasons, please do as follows to check the silicone pad inside the modules as the instruction below.

The audience can't help but wonder how can the machine be working for no reason. This kind of confusion can be avoided by moving **for no reason** next to **stop**:

>If the linear modules stop for no reason while the machine is working, please do as follows to check the silicone pad inside the modules.


### 1.4.2 Multiple Modifiers

When a noun or noun phrase is preceded by more than two modifiers, it begins to look hard on the eyes.

Look at the following structures:

* An English language school teacher
* A recently rented small Council house
* The moving wheel gear casing

Grammar-wise, these expressions are okay, but they look awkward nonetheless. In situations like this, try and reduce the number of modifiers first. Ask yourself: is this modifier really necessary? Does it serve your purpose? If not, omit it.

Where each modifier provides indispensable information and can't be edited out, separate them with a preposition, a possessive form, a hyphen, or a clause. Don't jam them all together before the nouns or pronouns they describe. So don't say:

* The Linear Module motor circuit board
* The upcoming more powerful Laser Module
* A regularly maintained open source software

Instead, say:

* The Linear Module's motor circuit board
* The upcoming Laser Module that’s more powerful
* A regularly maintained open-source software


### 1.4.3 Noun Modifiers

Don't put more than two nouns before the central noun or noun phrase. For example, don't say:

* 3D printing sheet size
* Printer work table height

But it is okay to say:

* Machine temperature
* Heated Bed temperature
* Z-axis Holder

Where there are more than two nouns modifying the central noun or noun phrase, use possessive. For example, say:

* The size of the 3D printing sheet
* The height of printer worktable

A general rule is to use **'s** after a living organism and a brand, while use **of** for possessive of a lifeless object. To be specific, use **'s** after Snapmaker as a brand name, and use **of** to indicate possessive for Snapmaker's products, tools, and services. For example, say:

* Michel's comment
* Snapmaker's return policy
* The specifications of the machine
* The horsepower of Tesla Model 3
