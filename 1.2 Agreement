## **1.2 Agreement**

### **1.2.1 Pronoun-antecedent Agreement**

A pronoun is used to refer to a noun or noun phrase previously mentioned. To achieve word economy, as well as increase readability, it is encouraged that you use pronouns where appropriate, instead of spelling out the whole term all the time.

However, do check whether your reference is clear after you finish writing, as pronouns can mislead your audience when used inappropriately. In the following note, for example, it is hard to tell what **its** refers to:

>Note: Parts that are replaced under the Warranty also fall under its original warranty duration and do not restart.

On closer inspection, **its** might be referring to **parts** , but as **parts** is a plural noun, the correct pronoun should be **their**.


### **1.2.2 Subject-verb Agreement**

Although their misuse is not as confusing as that of pronouns and antecedents, it is essential that subjects and verbs agree with each other in number. The grammatical essentials are not covered in this guide. What this guide wants to stress are agreement and consistency.

For example, the following text refers to Snapmaker 2.0 as a single noun and a plural concept at the same time:

>Snapmaker 2.0, the modular 3-in-1 3D printers that unlock your full creative potential, from 3D printing to laser engraving, cutting, and CNC carving. Snapmaker 2.0 is smarter, faster, larger, and more powerful than ever before. It is a generation of 3-in-1 3D printers that come with everything you need!

Independently, each sentence in the text is correct, but this kind of switching creates difficulty for proofreading, content reuse, as well as localization. It can be improved by being more consistent in agreement:

>**Snapmaker 2.0**, the modular 3-in-1 3D **printer** that **unlocks** your full creative potential, from 3D printing to laser engraving, cutting, and CNC carving. **Snapmaker 2.0 is** smarter, faster, larger, and more powerful than ever before. **It is** a new generation of 3-in-1 3D **printer** that **comes** with everything you need!
